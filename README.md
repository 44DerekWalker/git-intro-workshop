## Outline

### What is Git?

- The **de facto** modern version control system.

- Git is like a **big album of _snapshots_** that helps you **keep track of changes** in your projects, and it's especially helpful when you're **working with others**.

  - Imagine you're making a big Lego creation and you want to remember all the steps you took to build it.

  - You could take a picture of your progress after each step, and then you would have a whole album of pictures showing how your Lego creation was built step by step.

  - **Git does the same thing, but instead of pictures, it takes snapshots of your code.**

  - This way, you can always go back to an earlier version if you need to make changes or fix a mistake.

  - And if you're working on a project with friends, you can use Git to share your changes with each other and see who made what changes.

- Developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux)

### Install

https://git-scm.com/downloads

**Windows**: Use the installer, which comes with Git Bash (emulator for bash and git)

** I recommend using [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) instead for various reasons.

**Linux:** use your package manager of choice.

**MacOS:** use homebrew/macports package manager, or the installer (recommend homebrew)

## Notes

<details>
<summary>Notes for Ben's üëÄ only</summary>

- Focus on the **mental model** of Git/GitHub.
- Only introduce git **fundamentals**, nothing fancy
- Start from the **local workflow**, then move to the **remote workflow**
- **USE VISUALS, DON‚ÄôT JUST SAY ‚ÄúRun this command‚Äù.** Memorizing commands comes with time (not the focus of the workshop), **understanding the mental model** is vital in the beginning
- Leave room for **questions**, **examples**, and **practice exercises**
