## Notes

<summary>Notes for Ben's üëÄ only</summary>

- Focus on the **mental model** of Git/GitHub.
- Only introduce git **fundamentals**, nothing fancy
- Start from the **local workflow**, then move to the **remote workflow**
- **USE VISUALS, DON‚ÄôT JUST SAY ‚ÄúRun this command‚Äù.** Memorizing commands comes with time (not the focus of the workshop), **understanding the mental model** is vital in the beginning
- Leave room for **questions**, **examples**, and **practice exercises**
